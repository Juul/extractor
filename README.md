Download the latest release zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/Juul/extractor/releases/).

To use the extractor on Windows, simply unzip this file and then drag the recorded .ts file onto the extract.bat file. This should create the file output.pdf in the same directory.

Remember to move output.pdf to another directory or delete it before running the extractor again.

If you instead prefer to use the command line, cd into the directory containing extract.bat and type:

extract.bat <name_of_recorded_file.ts>

This should create output.pdf

In the release, a test recording is included called recording.ts in the sample directory

You can try extracting from this file to verify that the program is working by dragging it onto extract.bat or running from the command line.
